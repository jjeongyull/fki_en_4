            It is part of the “Happy World for Children” project, which supports vulnerable households such as at-risk pregnant women, infants, and single-parent families. Launched in 2023, the “Happy World for Children” project is a large-scale joint social contribution initiative led by FKI and its member companies. Its core pillars include respect for the lives of at-risk infants, ensuring children’s health and well-being, and bridging the education gap for underprivileged groups.

            The “Hope Bus,” short for Hope Bus for Small Business Owners and SMEs, is a traveling consultation program in which the FKI Business Advisory Group visits local governments across the country to provide free, customized management advice and consulting.<br>
            In October last year, FKI signed a cooperation agreement with Gwangju Metropolitan City and KB Financial Group to support small business owners with tailored business consulting services. Starting with its first run in Gwangju on March 4, FKI plans to expand the Hope Bus nationwide to help strengthen the foundations for regional SME growth.<br>
            Since its launch in 2004, the FKI Business Advisory Group has provided managerial expertise to approximately 15,000 SMEs and small businesses, producing numerous success stories. The group consists of 195 former CEOs and executives from major corporations, as well as 34 experts in legal, tax, labor, and other professional fields.

            From May 20 to 22, FKI hosted the Happy Seoul Outing for Children for single-parent families who had never visited the capital, offering children a memorable cultural experience. The event’s slogan was “A Dreamy Attic! Smiling and Laughing Together”—with “smiling and laughing” expressed in the Jeju dialect as “bingsaegi useumeong.” More than 30 mothers and children affiliated with Aeseowon—a Jeju-based welfare institution supporting at-risk pregnant women and single-parent families—enjoyed a joyful three-day itinerary visiting major landmarks like Gyeongbokgung Palace and N Seoul Tower.<br>
            Separately, on May 31, another group of 30 mothers and children from Mokpo’s House of the Virgin Mary, a key support center for at-risk pregnant women in the Jeollanam-do region, also visited Seoul for a three-day outing.
