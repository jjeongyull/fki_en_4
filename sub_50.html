The global growth forecast was also lowered to 2.8%, with most major economies—including the U.S., Europe, and China—seeing downward revisions.

The surge is driven by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, rising global defense budgets, and the fact that procurement systems are becoming less U.S.-centered.

The sharp adjustment reflects the impact of U.S. tariffs and domestic demand slowdown, which have weighed heavily on exports, consumption, and construction investment. Although inflationary pressures have eased, allowing for a rate cut, risks from household debt, exchange rate volatility, and the widening U.S.-Korea interest rate gap remain concerning.</div>

However, real GDP for Q1 fell by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter due to sluggish construction and equipment investment. The low dollar-denominated growth rate can be attributed to a rising KRW–USD exchange rate.

The managed fiscal balance is projected to worsen, reaching 4.5% of the GDP. Experts urged caution in future revenue sourcing as the tax base has weakened due to tax cuts and the economic slowdown.

                        <div class="swiper-txt">The KOSPI index rose above the 3,000 mark for the first time since December 2021. Key drivers included the new administration’s pro-market policies, anticipation of rate cuts, and the passage of a KRW 35 trillion supplementary budget, which attracted foreign investors. Defense, shipbuilding, AI, and KRW stablecoin-related stocks rallied. The presidential office declared a bold ambition: “We will usher in the 5,000 era.”

                          <div class="swiper-txt">A recent analysis revealed that Korean exporters have underperformed in rapidly expanding global markets. Between 2015 and 2022, Korea’s market share in 200 key growth markets declined, while China increased its share to 31.2%. Even in core sectors like semiconductors and batteries, Chinese export growth outpaced Korea’s. Experts are calling for stronger product development, increased investment in emerging industries, and more aggressive market-entry support from the government.

According to Hyundai Research Institute, tourism revenue could reach USD 20.25 billion (KRW 29.4 trillion), accounting for roughly 2.5% of domestic consumption. The influx is anticipated to significantly stimulate domestic demand. It further highlights the growing importance of tourism as a sustainable driver of economic growth.
