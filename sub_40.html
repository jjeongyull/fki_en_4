            On May 19, the Korean economic delegation participated in the Korea–France Special Roundtable held at the Palace of Versailles. The meeting brought together President Emmanuel Macron, French government ministers, and major industry leaders to discuss economic collaboration between the two countries. Notably, this was the only bilateral business meeting hosted within the 2025 Choose France Summit—underscoring its significance.<br>
            Choose France, hosted by President Macron, is France’s flagship business event, held annually to promote the country’s industrial and investment environment. The event invites 100 to 150 CEOs from leading global companies each year. Now in its eighth iteration, this year’s summit included six invited Korean companies: FKI (Chairman Jin Roy Ryu), CJ Group (Chairman Kyung-shik Sohn), Korean Air (Chairman Won-tae Cho), SPC Group (President Jin-soo Hur), Hyundai Motor Company (Vice Chairman Jae-hoon Chang), and Enchem (CEO Jung-kang Oh). The French were represented by President Macron; Jean-Noël Barrot, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs; François Jackow, CEO of Air Liquide; and senior executives from BNP Paribas and Airbus.<br>
            The roundtable centered on strengthening industrial cooperation between Korea and France and exploring the local investment environment in France. Korean participants also attended additional sessions hosted by President Macron, including 1:1 ministerial meetings and B2B events with over 200 global CEOs. Key topics included carbon neutrality, clean energy, and defense, with discussions aimed at expanding bilateral cooperation in these fields.

            On May 20, the day after the Choose France Summit, FKI co-hosted the 2nd Korea–France Business Dialogue for Our Future with the Movement of the Enterprises of France (MEDEF) at Station F in Paris—the world’s largest startup campus. Launched in May 2023 in Seoul, this dialogue platform has since become the leading channel for promoting cooperation between the private sectors of Korea and France.<br>
            To attend this year’s dialogue, a delegation of around 50 representatives from 20 Korean companies—including Hyundai Motor Company, LG Chem, Korean Air, Hanwha Solutions, CJ Group, POSCO, and Poongsan—visited Paris. On the French side, approximately 70 participants joined from companies such as Air Liquide, TotalEnergies, Airbus, Thales, BNP Paribas, and STMicroelectronics.<br>
            The dialogue featured wide-ranging discussions focused on practical cooperation between Korea and France in decarbonized mobility and industry, aerospace, advanced materials, and startups.

            POSCO and LG Chem represented Korea in the decarbonized industry session. Yun-ju Ko, Executive Vice President of LG Chem, noted that global momentum for decarbonization has weakened due to the rising cost of ESG compliance. As strategies to address this challenge, he proposed modular upgrades to existing facilities, risk-sharing in R&D through public-private partnerships, and expanded global joint ventures, stressing the importance of collaboration to achieve carbon neutrality.
